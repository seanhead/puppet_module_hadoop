This is a puppet module for installing, configuring and starting the hadoop (http://hadoop.apache.org/) hdfs and mapreduce services.

NOTE: This module was mainly tested on RHEL/CentOS 5 using puppet 2.6.x

* Requirements:
	- hadoop built into an rpm (source installs will be supported soon)
	- puppet ( 2.6+ recommended) installed on all servers

Usage:
1. Define the following in hadoop::vars:
	- hadoop version
	- hadoop rpm version
	- hadoop home
	- jdk rpm version
	- jdk home

2. Add the required classes to nodes in pupppet
3. Run puppet on the namenode first.
4. Format the namenode (ONLY DO THIS ON A FRESH INSTALL). As the hadoop user run:

	hadoop namenode -format

5. Run puppet on the rest of the nodes

Example usage:

	node "r01sv01.jnet.lan" {
		include hadoop::namenode
	}

	node "r01sv02.jnet.lan" {
		include hadoop::jobtracker
		include hadoop::secondary_namenode
	}

	node "r01sv03.jnet.lan" {
		include hadoop::datanode
		include hadoop::tasktracker
	}

	node "r01sv04.jnet.lan" {
		# This node has more cpus/ram then others
		
		# Define the node specific differences in configuration
		class {"hadoop::vars":
			maptasks => 3,
			reducetasks => 5
		}
		
		# Include the service classes
		include hadoop::datanode
		include hadoop::tasktracker
	}

	node "r01sv05.jnet.lan" {
		# This node has several harddrives already mounted
		
		# Define the node specific differences in configuration
		class {"hadoop::vars":
			clouddirs = ["/disk1","/disk2"]
		}
		
		# Include the service classes
		include hadoop::datanode
		include hadoop::tasktracker
	}

	node "r01sv06.jnet.lan" {
		# This node will be retired soon so the services are disabled
		class {"hadoop::datanode": enabled => false }
		class {"hadoop::tasktracker": enabled => false }
	}
